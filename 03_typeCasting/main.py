# There are 2 types of casting present in the python

# 1. Implicit typeCasting

# 2. Explicit typeCasting

# Example of implicit typeCasting
a = 2; # a is int 
b = 3.6; # b is float
c = a+b;


# print(type(c))
# print(c)

# we can convert valid strings into the another data types



d = "12";
e = "44";
f = "harry" # gives error

# Explicit typeCasting
# print(int(d)+int(e)+int(f))
print(float(d)+float(e))
